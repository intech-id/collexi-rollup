//! This is Verification key generator for PLONK prover.
//! Verification keys depends on universal setup and circuit,
//! jthat is why for each version of circuit they can be generated only once.
//! Process of generation of this keys is CPU and memory consuming,
//! so developers are expected to download verification keys from public space.
//! After Verification keys are generated for all of our circuits
//! we can generate verifying contract, that is also deterministic for current circuit version.
//!
//! Only parameters that determine process of these generation is `SUPPORTED_BLOCK_CHUNKS_SIZES`
//! and `SUPPORTED_BLOCK_CHUNKS_SIZES_SETUP_POWERS` that are read from env in config files.
//! Before generating parameters universal setup keys should be downloaded using `zksync plonk-setup` command.
