/// # Retrying Functionality
///
/// The design goals of this wrappers are speed and robustness: since most of the times
/// database will be available, the overhead introduces by this wrapper should not be
/// big. On the other hand, if the database is unavailable, we only care about restoring
/// the connection, and thus the speed is not a highest priority.
///
/// In an actual implementation, this means that in normal conditions the only overhead
/// we have to deal with is introduced by using `RefCell` (and that's not much).
///
/// If the connection breaks, we will try to establish a new one (because Diesel can't
/// restore the existing connection: once it's broken, it's broken) in a loop with an
/// increasing intervals between attempts.
///
/// # Enabling or Disabling
///
/// The retrying functionality can be either turned on or off, so the existing connection
/// can modify its behavior while being used as a part of the connections pool.
///
/// More than that, retrying functionality is disabled *by default*, since the Diesel
/// connection pool can re-create connections on its own, and we don't want the connection
/// to retry the operation unless it was explicitly enabled. Instead, the `ConnectionPool`
/// structure manages this setting upon every storage access request.
