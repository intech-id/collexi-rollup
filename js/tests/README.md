1. [Install miniconda (or anaconda)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. [Install tslab](https://github.com/yunabe/tslab)
3. in $ZKSYNC_HOME/js/tests, run `f jupyter notebook`
4. When jupyter opens in browser, open Tests.ipynb
5. You may want to relaunch jupyter with ctrl+c and `f jupyter notebook --no-browser` after each environment reset, so that jupyter has the latest env variables
